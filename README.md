# Website

The docs page is live [here!](https://mindstormer-0.github.io/daq-tool/)

### Local Development of docs

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The github action should automatically deploy to the `gh-pages` branch
